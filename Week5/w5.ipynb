    "AdaBoost uses the idea of weighted training set - the higher the weight of an example, the more difficult it was for the previous classifiers. It trains a classifier, evaluates its performance on the training data and then increases the weights of the misclassified training examples. Then it trains a second classififier using the updated weights, again makes predictions on the training data, updates the weights of the training data and so on. Once all models are trained, their predictions are combined using weighed vote based on their accuracy on the training data. For more information, please se the lecture slides and textbooks.\n",

    "Gradient Boosting also works by sequentially adding new  models to the ensemble, with each new model trying to predict correctly the misclassified examples by the previous models.
